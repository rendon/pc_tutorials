TopCoder Tutorials (remastered)
===============================
This repository contains some TopCoder algorithm tutorials with a better formatting to be easy to read and print.

These tutorials are not derived works, these tutorials are exactly the same you can find at <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=alg_index" target="_blank">TopCoder's official site</a>, the only difference is that these tutorials have an improved formatting to be easy to read or even to print, at least for me.

Disclaimer
==========
The rights of the materials (the tutorials) belongs to TopCoder<sup>TM</sup>, I only am trying to improve the quality of the formatting but if I am breaking the law just let me  know and I'll stop.
